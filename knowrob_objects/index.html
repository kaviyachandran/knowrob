<h1 class="wiki">knowrob_objects</h1>

<p>
Utilities for reasoning about objects,
and for maintaining beliefs about them.</p>

<p>
In particular relevant are visual and
geometrical properties such as
color (<a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=object_color/3">object_color/3</a>),
size (<a href="objects.html#object_dimensions/4">object_dimensions/4</a>),
mesh (<a href="objects.html#object_mesh_path/2">object_mesh_path/2</a>), and
pose (<a href="objects.html#current_object_pose/2">current_object_pose/2</a>, <a href="objects.html#object_pose_at_time/3">object_pose_at_time/3</a>) of an object.</p>

<p>
Beliefs may be updated based on objects the robot perceived.
There are several utility predicates in <code class="nofile">beliefstate.pl</code> that
can be used for updating beliefs about objects:
where they are, in which frame they are fixed, and
how their properties change over time.</p>

<p>
In addition, users may assert perception events
to the knowledge base that describe the mental process of perceiving
and what the outcome was for a particular event instance.
Utility predicates for maintaining such perception events can be found in
<code class="nofile">perception.pl</code>.</p>

<h3 class="wiki">object_state_publisher.py</h3>

<p>
An additional script is provided that is used to publish
object transforms on the ROS tf topic along with
marker visualization messages.
This is realized as a json_prolog client that
initially loads all known objects, and
provides a service to mark objects as "dirty" which causes
the script to reload the dirty objects, and
to republish tf and marker visualization messages.</p>

<p>
You can run the publisher with:</p>

<pre class="code">
rosrun knowrob_objects object_state_publisher.py
